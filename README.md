**User Behavior and Cooking Preferences Analysis**
This repository contains the analysis of user behavior, cooking preferences, and order trends using three datasets: UserDetails, CookingSessions, and OrderDetails. The primary objective of this project is to explore how user demographics, cooking sessions, and orders are related, identify popular dishes, and uncover insights that can help improve customer experience and business operations.

Project Overview
The datasets used in this project include:

UserDetails: Contains information about users, including their demographic details such as age, gender, and location.
CookingSessions: Provides data on the cooking sessions users participate in, including the types of dishes prepared and session timings.
OrderDetails: Captures information on user orders, including dish names, order times, and other transactional details.
The main tasks and analysis performed include:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and incorrect data entries in the three datasets.
Data Merging: Combining the datasets to create a unified view of user behavior across different platforms.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigating the relationships between user demographics, cooking sessions, and order trends.
Trend Analysis: Identifying popular dishes based on the frequency of orders and cooking sessions.
Demographic Insights: Exploring how user characteristics (e.g., age, gender, location) influence their cooking preferences and ordering patterns.
Visualization: Creating visualizations to clearly present insights, trends, and correlations.
